File Metadata Microservice
==========================

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks](https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks). Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

*   Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata/) and complete your project locally.
*   Use [our Gitpod starter project](https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-filemetadata/) to complete your project. Learn [how to share your Gitpod workspace to get help](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-use-gitpod-in-the-curriculum/668669#how-can-i-share-my-workspace-to-get-help-8).
*   Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

**HINT:** You can use the `multer` npm package to handle file uploading.

Tests
-----

1\. You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
    
2\. You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
    
3\. The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
    
4\. When you submit a file, you receive the file `name`, `type`, and `size` in bytes within the JSON response.
